# Tidy data-set Code Book

## Introduction
This repository contains my work for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project. It takes as input inertial sensor data from smartphones for multple subjects performing normal activities, and processes it to create a "tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

## Study design
We were given the data set to work on in our course; we did not design any experiments or collect any data ourselves.

The data came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - the __Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set__ The abstract:
> Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Raw data processing
The  ```output_data.txt``` output file was generated by the "October 2015 - v1.00" version of my ```run_analysis.R``` script. No other automated or manual changes were made to the input files or to the output file. See the __Running the script__ section in the README.md for more details.

The script was run against the data provided in the compressed file provided for the course, from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  and was downloaded in mid October, 2015. More details are available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The next section describes the output file ```output_data.txt```
